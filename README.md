## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Julian, and welcome to my GitHub profile!
### ðŸš€ Data Protection & Privacy Technologist | Cognitive Scientist in Education | Privacy & Security Enthusiast

Iâ€™m currently working as a Data Protection & Privacy Technologist at SURF, where Iâ€™m part of the Vendor Compliance team. Here, I focus on making sure the applications and systems used by Dutch educational and research institutions meet top-notch privacy and security standards. My role is hands-on: I dive deep into technical investigations, scrutinize data flows, and advise vendors on ways to tighten up their systems and minimize risks.

With a Bachelorâ€™s in Information & Communication Technologies, I built a solid foundation in cybersecurity, software development, and project management. Next to my job at SURF, Iâ€™m also pursuing a Masterâ€™s in Cognitive Science at OsnabrÃ¼ck University, where I focus primarily on Artificial Intelligence. My studies are driven by a deep curiosity about how the mind functions and how AI will shape the future of privacy and security. Iâ€™m especially interested in exploring the intersection of AI and data protectionâ€”how we can use AI responsibly to enhance privacy and security without compromising ethics.
